Hi my name’s Andrew Sykut, having served as a Navy EOD tech, my expertise extends beyond explosives into the workings of computers. I find myself just as comfortable defusing a bomb as I am navigating lines of code. Whether I'm fine-tuning a robot's programming in the field or dissecting intricate digital triggers. I’ve taken all JAVA based programming courses up to this point.

I'm drawn to learning web programming, especially CSS and HTML, because it's it sounds like a challenge. With everything moving online, I want to grasp these languages to stay relevant and be able to appreciate webs apps. Taking a web programming course isn't just about gaining skills, but about becoming exposing myself to a new way of thinking!

## Notes
## What is CI/CD?
- CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA "integration hell").

## What is MVC?
- MVC is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.
