Hi my name’s Andrew Sykut, having served as a Navy EOD tech, my expertise extends beyond explosives into the workings of computers. I find myself just as comfortable defusing a bomb as I am navigating lines of code. Whether I'm fine-tuning a robot's programming in the field or dissecting intricate digital triggers. I’ve taken all JAVA based programming courses up to this point.

I'm drawn to learning web programming, especially CSS and HTML, because it's it sounds like a challenge. With everything moving online, I want to grasp these languages to stay relevant and be able to appreciate webs apps. Taking a web programming course isn't just about gaining skills, but about becoming exposing myself to a new way of thinking!
